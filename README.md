# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

For this project, I made a schedule planner for an average work day. By doing this project, I learned how to how to store data in local storage and display that data on the webpage. I also learned how to display the current date and time on a webpage, and how to use jquery to add functionality to a website.

## Usage

To use this application, click in one of the time blocks and type your plan for that hour of the day. Next, click the button with the lock icon to the right of the time block you've typed in. The information you typed will be saved in the time block until you change the information. Keep in mind, the color of the time blocks changes throughout the day. If a time block is grey, that time has already passed for the day. If a time block is red, that is the current time of day. If a time block is green, that time of day has not happened yet.
